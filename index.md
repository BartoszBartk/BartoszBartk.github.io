I am an environmental economist at UFZ - Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany. My research focus is on the economic analysis of agri-environmental policy instruments as means to navigate ecosystem service trade-offs in multifunctional landscapes. In this context, I am particularly interested in identifying policy instruments and instrument mixes allowing to align societal preferences with biophysical potential of landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services. Here, the mutual relationship between regulatory and incentive-based instruments is of much interest. Using agent-based modelling, but also more qualitative approaches, I look at the emerging landscape-level patterns that result from various policy mixes given realistic descriptions of farmers' behaviour and institutional settings.

I did my PhD (Dr. rer. pol.) in environmental economics at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in 2017. The topic of my PhD was the economic valuation of biodiversity, with a special focus on deliberative monetary valuation. Between the topic of my PhD and my current focus, I have rather diverse research interests and have also worked and published on ecosystem service trade-offs, ecosystem services & property rights, farmers' behavioural characteristics, governance and ethics of genome-edited food, growth imperatives and the democratic deficits in the degrowth debate. Check out my publication list and the <a href="https://bartoszbartk.github.io/pages/research.html">Research</a> tab for more information and detail.

While working at a research-only centre, I have some teaching experience, including a course on conservation economics (Naturschutzökonomik) that I have been giving at the Hochschule Anhalt in Bernburg since 2017.

Before discovering economics I did my bachelor's in cultural studies (focus on Russia and ex-Yugoslavia). I am married and father of two. In my free time I enjoy drinking tea, listening to jazz, reading (philosophy, SF and fantasy) and watching arthouse films.
