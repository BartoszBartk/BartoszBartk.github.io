I am an environmental economist at UFZ - Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany. I did my PhD (Dr. rer. pol.) in environmental economics at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in 2017. The topic of my PhD was the economic valuation of biodiversity, with a special focus on deliberative monetary valuation. Currently, I am working mainly on land-use, especially agri-environmental policy. I have rather diverse research interests and have also worked and published on ecosystem service trade-offs, ecosystem services & property rights, farmers' behaviour, governance and ethics of genome-edited food, growth imperatives and the democratic deficits in the degrowth debate. So far, I have worked almost exclusively conceptually and qualitatively, but I am currently in the process of acquiring and (soon) applying skills in agent-based modelling as a way of analysis of agri-environmental land-use policy.

Before discovering economics I did my bachelor's in cultural studies (focus on Russia and ex-Yugoslavia). I am married and father of two. In my free time I enjoy drinking tea, listening to jazz, reading (philosophy, SF and fantasy) and watching arthouse films.

I am not on the job market right now. Just showing off.
