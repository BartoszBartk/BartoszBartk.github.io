#### BonaRes Centre
My main work currently happens within the BMBF-funded (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) project <i>BonaRes - Soil as a sustainable resource for a bioeconomy</i>. The project's homepage with more information, lots of materials and multiple sub-portals (partly still in development) can be found <a href="https://www.bonares.de/">here</a>. My work within BonaRes focuses on governance of agricultural soils, particularly analysis and design of policy instruments. Currently, I am working on the topic of context-specific soil policy instruments - first in a conceptual way, later possibly with the help of agent-based modelling (ABM). Prospectively, I plan combining ABM with the process-based soil model Bodium currently being developed within BonaRes. Furthermore, I am co-developing the governance part of BonaRes' Assessment, Foresight and Governance Platform, which is supposed to bundle knowledge on soil governance-relevant themes. Among those, the Governance Platform will provide governance-relevant information about actors involved in the soil policy field (farmers, food consumers, retailers etc.).

#### Farmers' behaviour
A central element of my perspective on analysis and design of policy instruments is a proper understanding of the behaviour of relevant actors. In the agri-environmental context, these are especially farmers. In collaboration with multiple colleagues at the UFZ, we are currently working on synthesising empirical (see Bartkowski and Bartke 2018) and theoretical knowledge about the determinants of European farmers' behaviour. The thus generated knowledge will then be used for both policy analysis and social-ecological modelling. In addition, I am collaborating with three colleagues to shed more light into the role of German farmers' identity and their image of a "good farmer", and how this influences their behaviour.

#### Agent-based modelling
Within and beyond BonaRes, I am trying to expand my own portfolio of methods by learning and finally applying agent-based modelling (ABM) approaches. Given my focus on agri-environmental land-use policy and my great interest in behavioural research informing policy design, ABM is quite well a fit. Also, it provides great opportunities to combine social/economic with biophysical models to tackle policy-relevant questions from an interdisciplinary perspective. In this context, I am collaborating with colleagues from the UFZ to develop ways of combining of biophysical landscape optimization modelling with ABM in order to identify realistic and policy-relevant scenarios for the reconfiguration of multifunctional landscapes.

#### Governance of CRISPR
An ongoing interest of mine is the societal role of agricultural tech innovations. In this context, I collaborated with colleagues from the universities of Halle-Wittenberg, Kassel and Bonn to provide some mainly conceptual insights into the economics, ethics and governance of CRISPR-based genome editing of food crops (see Bartkowski et al. 2018, Pirscher et al. 2018, Bartkowski 2019). A paper in which a Chad Baum and I use Albert Hirschman's famous exit-voice framework to analyse the governance and legitimacy of genome-edited food is currently under review.
