The overarching theme of my research is the conditions for a transformation towards an environmentally sustainable agriculture in the German and European context. I look at this from an economic/social-science perspective, but most of my research happens in a strongly interdisciplinary context. This overarching theme combines a number of topics that I am interested in: multifunctionality of cultural landscapes (incl. ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies); farmers' behaviour; the institutional context of agri-environmental policy; incentive-based agri-environmental policy instruments; modern agricultural technologies (digitalization, genome editing, bioeconomy). Methodologically, I am quite flexible; but agent-based modelling has recently become a focus, as it is particularly well-suited to foster the understanding of the landscape-level effects of farmers' behaviour, technologies and incentives, all of which usually work mainly at the farm level.

Some more specific current or recent research endeavours include:

### Governance of sustainable soil management
My main work currently happens within the BMBF-funded (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) project <i>BonaRes - Soil as a sustainable resource for a bioeconomy</i>. The project's homepage with more information, lots of materials and multiple sub-portals (partly still in development) can be found <a href="https://www.bonares.de/">here</a>. My work within BonaRes focuses on governance of agricultural soils, particularly analysis and design of policy instruments. In this context, I have been developing novel policy instruments to harness the potential offered by modern process-based modelling of soil functions. The motivation is to increase the context-sensitivity of soil-related policy instruments. Prospectively, I plan combining ABM with the process-based soil model Bodium currently being developed within BonaRes. Furthermore, I am co-developing the governance part of BonaRes' Assessment, Foresight and Governance Platform, which is supposed to bundle knowledge on soil governance-relevant themes. Among those, the <a href="https://www.bonares.de/socioeconomics/governanceinstruments">Governance Platform</a> provides governance-relevant information about actors involved in the soil policy field (farmers, food consumers, retailers etc.).

### Farmers' behaviour
A central element of my perspective on analysis and design of policy instruments is a proper understanding of the behaviour of relevant actors. In the agri-environmental context, these are especially farmers. In collaboration with multiple colleagues at the UFZ, we are currently working on synthesising empirical (see Bartkowski and Bartke 2018) and theoretical knowledge about the determinants of European farmers' behaviour. The thus generated knowledge will then be used for both policy analysis and social-ecological modelling. Starting in September 2019, I will be supervising a PhD student working experimentally into the determinants of farmers' behaviour with respect to various agri-environmental policy instruments.

### Agent-based modelling
Within and beyond BonaRes, I am expanding my own method portfolio by learning and finally applying agent-based modelling (ABM) approaches, which fit well with my focus on agri-environmental land-use policy and my great interest in behavioural research informing policy design. Also, ABM provide great opportunities to combine social/economic with biophysical models to tackle policy-relevant questions from an interdisciplinary perspective. In this context, I am collaborating with colleagues from the UFZ to develop ways of combining biophysical landscape optimization modelling with ABM in order to identify realistic and policy-relevant scenarios for the reconfiguration of multifunctional landscapes.

### Impacts and governance of agricultural technologies
An ongoing interest of mine is the societal role of agricultural tech innovations. In this context, I collaborated with colleagues from the universities of Halle-Wittenberg, Kassel and Bonn to provide some mainly conceptual insights into the economics, ethics and governance of CRISPR-based genome editing of food crops (see Bartkowski et al. 2018, Pirscher et al. 2018, Bartkowski 2019, Bartkowski and Baum 2019). Also, together with colleagues from Turku and Lund, we are looking at bioeconomy - a potential game-changer in modern agriculture - from a scenario-oriented ecosystem service perspective. Meanwhile, at the UFZ, I have been involved in the development of land-use scenarios, including high-tech scenarios oriented towards sustainability.

### Deliberative monetary valuation
This has been a major topic for me during my PhD thesis. Right now it is only a topic for infrequent side-projects, but an interesting one. Recently, I collaborated with Marije Schaafsma (U of Southampton) and my former supervisor Nele Lienhoop (University of Applied Sciences Bochum) on a guidance paper for deliberative monetary valuation studies.
