The overarching theme of my research is the conditions for a transformation towards an environmentally sustainable agriculture in the German and European context. I look at this from an economic/social-science perspective, but most of my research happens in a strongly interdisciplinary context. This overarching theme combines a number of topics that I am interested in: multifunctionality of landscapes (incl. ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies); insights into the determinants of farmers' behaviour; the institutional context of agri-environmental policy; incentive-based agri-environmental policy instruments and their relationship to other instrument types; modern agricultural technologies (digitalization, genome editing, bioeconomy). Methodologically, I am rather flexible; <i>agent-based modelling</i> has recently become a focus, as it is particularly well-suited to foster the understanding of the landscape-level effects of farmers' behaviour, technologies and incentives, all of which usually work mainly at the farm level.

Some more specific current or recent research endeavours include:

#### Analysis and design of agri-environmental policy mix
My main work currently happens within the BMBF-funded (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) project <i>BonaRes - Soil as a sustainable resource for a bioeconomy</i> (<a href="https://www.bonares.de/">project homepage</a>). My work within BonaRes focuses on governance of agricultural soils, particularly analysis and design of policy instruments. In this context, I have been developing novel policy instruments to harness the potential offered by modern process-based modelling of soil functions (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08219">Bartkowski et al. 2019</a>). The motivation is to increase the context-sensitivity of soil-related policy instruments. Also, I have looked at the broader institutional setting of agricultural soil management (<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/7/2447">Bartkowski et al. 2018</a>) and the determinants of farmers' soil management decisions (<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/9/3179">Bartkowski and Bartke 2018</a>) as important preconditions for a proper understanding of the soil policy mix. These insights are being collated in the governance part of BonaRes' Assessment, Foresight and Governance Platform. Among those, the <a href="https://www.bonares.de/socioeconomics/governanceinstruments">Governance Platform</a> provides governance-relevant information about actors involved in the soil policy field (farmers, food consumers, retailers etc.).

Going beyond soil management, I have been working with colleagues from natural sciences on ecosystem conservation and land-use policy in agricultural landscapes. Here, my focus has been on the identification of options for moving closer to the biophysical potential of agricultural landscape to jointly provide multiple ecosystem services (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00103/abstract">Bartkowski et al. 2020</a>).

#### Agent-based modelling and farmers' behaviour
Around 2018 I started putting agent-based modelling into the centre of my method portfolio. I consider this modelling approach as particularly promising in terms of addressing the research questions I am particularly interested in, i.e. how agri-environmental policy instrument mixes influence the land management decisions of individual farmers, and how this then translates into emergent landscape-level effects, e.g. in terms of the provision of ecosystem servies. Methodologically, I am particularly interested in rich and theory-based representations of agents' behaviour, e.g. by drawing upon social psychology theories. More generally, proper understanding of the behaviour of relevant actors is a central element of my perspective on analysis and design of policy instruments. Since September 2019, I have been supervising a PhD student working experimentally into the determinants of farmers' behaviour with respect to various agri-environmental policy instruments.

Together with colleagues from the UFZ, I developed an approach for <i>aligning agent-based modelling with multi-objective land-use allocation</i> (ALABAMA) to better understand the interplay of the biophysical potential of landscapes for multifunctionality and behavioural, social and economic factors that affect the feasibility of reaching this potential (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00103/abstract">Bartkowski et al. 2020</a>). The ALABAMA approach will be developed further by a PhD student I co-supervise (starting in June 2020).

#### Impacts and governance of agricultural technologies
An ongoing interest of mine is the societal role of agricultural tech innovations. In this context, I collaborated with colleagues from the universities of Halle-Wittenberg, Kassel and Bonn to provide some mainly conceptual insights into the economics, ethics and governance of CRISPR-based genome editing of food crops (see <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718518302215">Bartkowski et al. 2018</a>, Pirscher et al. 2018, Bartkowski 2019, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2019.00057/abstract">Bartkowski and Baum 2019</a>). Also, together with colleagues from Turku and Lund, we are looking at bioeconomy - a potential game-changer in modern agriculture - from a scenario-oriented ecosystem service perspective. Meanwhile, at the UFZ, I have been involved in the development of land-use scenarios, including high-tech scenarios oriented towards sustainability.

#### Economic valuation
Economic valuation has been a major topic for me during my PhD thesis. Right now it is mainly a topic for side-projects, but an interesting one. Recently, I collaborated with Marije Schaafsma (U of Southampton) and my former supervisor Nele Lienhoop (University of Applied Sciences Bochum) on a guidance paper for deliberative monetary valuation studies. Furthermore, within BonaRes we look at the potential of economic valuation to provide information about societal preferences for soil functions.
